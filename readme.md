LemonKat's MLA-9 citation generator

This is one of my oldest projects, so excuse the bad formatting.

I got sick of writing MLA-9 style citations so decided to create a citation generator tool. First, I created a simple, LISP-like programming language. (It's very slow, and the only data type is String. However, there are ways to make pairs of strings as strings.)

Then, the custom programming language is used to create a MLA-9 citation generator, which reformats the citation list exactly as it's supposed to be formatted according to MLA-9.

To run:
1. run `python3 main.py`
