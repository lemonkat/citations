### LemonKat's citation generator

This is one of my oldest projects, so excuse the bad formatting.

This project does 2 things:  
First, this project is a simple, Lisp-like programming language.  
It's very slow, and the only data type is String. However, there are ways to make pairs of strings as strings.

Then, this project writes a functional MLA-9 citation generator, which formats the citation list exactly as it's supposed to be formatted.

#### To run:
1. run `python3 main.py`
